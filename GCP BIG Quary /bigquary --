Big Quary is  google modern warehouse and biqdata tool 
its is serverless no neeed to create a cluster 
it is higly scalable ( storage + compute)
to work with large data and datasets 
bigquary come with bilt in sql enginer 
here we only store data structure only 
we can dirrectly go for development 
biqquary store data in columnary 
bigquary process terabit of data in miinits and petabit of data in secouds


things we can do in bigquary 
- collect the data from  both streamning and batch processing 
-it gives both real time and batch processing 
- process and transform 
- analysis 

 in biguary mmain focus is  
 - madillion archithure 
 - gold , sliver , bronze layer 
 - clusterung and partictuning of data 


 since bigqueary  pricing model is based on size of  data 
 there are two storage optimizatin are there 
1 partitioning 
2 clusterning 


 partitioning 



-dividing large data into smaller chunks 
-it easy to manage / quary 
-due to partictioing we get good performance 
-it can be done when creating the table 
-u can convert already existing table in to partictioning 
- cost control 

partictioning are classifird into two types 

1 integer range part 
2 time unit part
3 injection time part

1 . integer range ==
  column -id int 
creteria :
 start :1
 end :100
interval :10  

2. tme unit column 
 column -dob (datetime)
part accourding to  hour , days , months , yers 

3. injection part 

column -ingest  at a perticlar time 
creteria:
 hour ,days,mountly , year 


particationing limitation 

- parting column can br only once 
- parting column can be only-> int ,datetime ,injection time 
- it cant be done in  string , float ,book 






clustering 

- organzing /sorting the table  with one or more columns 

limitation :
- max four columns can be clustred in a data 
-clustering columns can  done in string , int , data ----
- cannot be done in flot 


- our cgo for both clustering and partictiong and  if u like to go only parting or only clustering
