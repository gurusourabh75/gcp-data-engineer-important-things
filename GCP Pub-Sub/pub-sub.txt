pub sub 

-- Pub/Sub is a messaging service for exchanging event data among applications and services. A producer of data publishes messages to a Pub/Sub topic.
   A consumer creates a subscription to that topic. Subscribers either pull messages from a subscription or are configured as 
  webhooks for push subscriptions. Every subscriber must acknowledge each message within a configurable window of time.
