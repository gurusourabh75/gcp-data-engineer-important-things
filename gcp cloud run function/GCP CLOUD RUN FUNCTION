- cloud run function  lets brake down 

What is Cloud Run?

- Cloud Run lets you run your code (as a container) on Google’s servers —
You don’t have to manage any machines, and it automatically scales up or down.
- You package your code into a Docker container
- You deploy it to Cloud Run
- It runs on demand (e.g., when a request or event happens)
- Think of it like:“Google runs my app for me when something happens, and I only pay when it runs.”



What is Cloud Run Functions?

- Google added a simpler way to use Cloud Run — just like Cloud Functions — but under the hood, it runs on Cloud Run.
- You write your code normally (e.g., in Python, Node.js, Go), and Google automatically:
- Wraps it in a container 
- Deploys it to Cloud Run 
- Sets up an HTTPS endpoint or event trigger 
-So Cloud Run Functions = “Cloud Functions style development + Cloud Run infrastructure”




For triggering a file to bigquary we need :

1. Create Cloud Storage Bucket
2. Create Service Account
3. Create BigQuery Dataset
4. Create Cloud Run Function
5. Deploy the Cloud Run Function
6. Test the function by uploading sample csv data into GCS bucket
7. Check results in Google


and also should enable IAM service account to use cloud eun function  with  following  services they are :

BigQuery Data Editor
BigQuery Job User
Cloud Functions Invoker
Cloud Run Invoker
Eventarc Event Receiver
Logs Writer
Storage Object Viewer
